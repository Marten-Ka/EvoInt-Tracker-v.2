# EvoInt Tracker v2

This project consists of three sub projects:

- evoint-scripts (downloading system and data preparation for the Vikus Viewer)
- vikus-viewer (visualization of the prepared data)
- EvoInt (start- and information page)

You can execute the three subprojects independently of each other.
But it is recommended to fully setup all three subprojects, before starting up everything.
The reason for this is that the Vikus Viewer can be started, but if you don't setup the evoint-scripts project, the Vikus Viewer is useless, because it can't display any data.
If you don't setup the Vikus Viewer, you can't navigate from the EvoInt Website to the Vikus Viewer.

Follow the installation steps displayed in the respective projects.
