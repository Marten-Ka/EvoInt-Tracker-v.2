# vikus-viewer-script v2.0

The script in /images will generate textures and spritesheet assets which are needed for the [vikus-viewer](https://github.com/cpietsch/vikus-viewer) (repo). The script in /tsne will generate a TSNE layout which can be used as an alternative to the timeline-view in VIKUS Viewer.


## Requirements
- nodejs
  - use the installer on https://nodejs.org/en/download/
  - or use nvm https://github.com/creationix/nvm


## Usage image script

Install the script as a command line tool without the need of cloning / downloading:

```sh
npm install -g vikus-viewer-script
```

Alternatively you can download or clone this repo and install the required node packages: 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cpietsch/vikus-viewer-script
cd vikus-viewer-script
npm install
```
Note: You can run the script via `node bin/textures` instead of `vikus-viewer-script` if you have cloned it.


All your images should be in one folder (lets say "images") and named x.jpg where x is the id of the image corresponding to the id field in data.csv

To generate textures and sprites run the script like this:

```sh
vikus-viewer-script "/path/to/your/images/*.jpg"
```

This will create a data folder for the textures (1024 and 4096) as well as a sprites folder for the spritesheets inside the current folder. You can also define an output folder via the output flag: `--output /path/to/output`

If your source images are in multiple formats or have multiple file extensions you can use a [glob primer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob#glob-primer) like this: `vikus-viewer-script "/path/to/your/images/*.+(jpg|jpeg|png)"`

You are now finished in preparing the textures and spritesheets!

Copy the folder 1024, 4096 and sprites inside data into your /data folder of your [vikus-viewer](https://github.com/cpietsch/vikus-viewer) instance. After a successful run you can delete the tmp folder.

*A note for collections of 5000+ items*: In the default configuration the script will generate sprites at the maximum dimensions of 256x256px. For faster loading time and collections with a lot of items, you should adjust the resolution of the sprites by running changing the ``--spriteSize`` flag to e.g.  90.

### Examples:

#### Create textures
```sh
vikus-viewer-script "/path/to/your/images/*.jpg" # on jpg's
vikus-viewer-script "/path/to/your/images/*.+(jpg|jpeg|png)" # on multiple formats
vikus-viewer-script "/path/to/your/images/**/*.jpg" # on all jpg's in subfolders
```

  -h, --help        Show help                                          [boolean]

Examples:
  vikus-viewer-script "/path/to/large/images/*.jpg"  create VV textures from jpgs
``` 

## Usage t-SNE/UMAP script

As an alternative to the temporal view, you can create a t-SNE layout based on image similarity. The script creates a tsne.csv which can be put next to the data.csv in the /data folder. Image similarity is calculated via the [mobilenet activation logit](https://beta.observablehq.com/@cpietsch/imagenet-activation-logit) and then run throught t-SNE or UMAP. An additional spacing step ensures no overlaying images in the distribution.

Download or clone this repo, navigate to /similarity and install the required node packages: 

```sh
cd /similarity
npm i
```

Run the t-SNE script:
```sh
node tsne.js -i /path/to/images
```

Alternatively Run the UMAP script UMAP is an experimental new version of way to do something similar to the T-SNE projection:

```sh
node umap.js -i /path/to/images
```

`/path/to/images` should be pointed low res images (made with the texture script) in the 1024px resolution. After you run the script a `tsne.csv` will be generated. Copy the csv into the data folder of your VIKUS Viewer instance and add an "tsne" entry to the loader section in the config.json file pointing to the tsne.csv file. Have a look at the [Van Gogh Example config](https://github.com/cpietsch/vikus-viewer-data/blob/master/vangogh/config.json#L10)
